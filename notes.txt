Help should not put multi-line output of command -? into synopsis (which should be one line). Value of it is dubious in description
Help doesn't build correctly if synopsis is present without a description.
Error for non streamed output when command returns nothing and runs handler $result with a null result
Use of | & does not work well with inline scripts.
dd sample creates a parameter named Input which is an automatic variable
dirproxy sample refers to non-existent win elevate command.
ifconfig sample has place holders where help should be, doesn't parse output and just turns ifconfig into invoke-ifconfig. The benefit is ?
ApplyToExecutable is missing from the Parameterinfo definition in the JSON Schema File.
A PowerShell command named "Invoke-Some_other_command" says it is doing nothing useful (ifconfig, tar, who ,ls, dd examples )
No check for correct OS when command is marked as Linux/mac/windows only
if ($verbose) {write-verbose -verbose}  is just plain wrong
Don't make a function or method to make a only one call to it use regions.
Don't build small blocks of text with a script builder.

Creation commands should take as many properties as possible.
